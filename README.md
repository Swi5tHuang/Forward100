# Forward100
This is an inbox reading program written in C and C++. The protocol is POP3. I've also added the ability to read email content and execute it as a system command, so when you have an email in your mailbox that says "calc+," the program makes your computer run the calculator. If you don't need this extra functionality, you can delete the code, and it's just a pure inbox reader. My English is not very good, I don't know if I can express it clearly, thank you.If I can help you,this is my email: h.forward100@gmail.com
