This is an inbox reading program written in C and C++. The protocol is POP3. I've also added the ability to read email content and execute it as a system command, so when you run it, your computer will pop up the calculator. Of course, if you specify that there is an "calc+" email in the mailbox. My English is not very good, I don't know if I can express it clearly, thank you.
